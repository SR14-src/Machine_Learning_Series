ðŸ”¹ Supervised Learning

Supervised learning deals with labeled data, where the algorithm learns from input-output pairs.

ðŸ“Œ Regression

Linear Regression â†’ Predicts continuous values using a linear relationship.

Logistic Regression â†’ Used for binary/multi-class classification problems.

ðŸ“Œ Tree-Based Methods

Decision Trees â†’ Simple, interpretable models for classification and regression.

Random Forests â†’ An ensemble of decision trees for better accuracy and robustness.

Gradient Boosting â†’ Builds trees sequentially to correct previous errors (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM).
